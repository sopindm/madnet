1. Buffers and buffer sequencies abstraction

byte[], char[], Object[] ...     |
                                 |  Buffers
ByteBuffer, CharBuffer           |

       | ByteArraySlice, ByteBufferSlice |
ISlice |                                 | Buffer sequencies

ISequence

IReadable = IGenerator   <-    Generators (Clojure seq's)
IWritable = IProcessor   <-    Processors (Clojure fns???)
  

2. Channel abstraction (buffer sequencies are channels)
2.5. Clojure seq's as read-only channels, clojure generators as write-only channels
3. Chain channels
4. Add java nio channels
5. Selectors
